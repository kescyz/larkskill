# im +messages-reply

> **Prerequisite:** Read [`../lark-shared/SKILL.md`](../../lark-shared/SKILL.md) first to understand authentication, global parameters, and safety rules.

Reply to a specific message. Supports both user identity (`as: 'user'`) and bot identity (`as: 'bot'`). Also supports thread replies.

This skill maps to the shortcut: `lark_api({ tool: 'im', op: 'messages-reply' })` (internally calls `POST /open-apis/im/v1/messages/:message_id/reply`).

## Safety Constraints

Replies sent by this tool are visible to other people. Before calling it, you **must** confirm with the user:

1. Which message to reply to
2. The reply content
3. Which identity to use (user or bot)

**Do not** send a reply without explicit user approval.

When using `as: 'bot'`, the reply is sent in the app's name, so make sure the app has already been added to the target chat.

When using `as: 'user'`, the reply is sent as the authorized end user and requires the `im:message.send_as_user` and `im:message` scopes.

## Choose The Right Content Flag

| Need | Recommended arg | Why |
|------|------|------|
| Reply with plain text exactly as written | `text` | Wrapped directly to `{"text":"..."}` |
| Reply with simple Markdown and accept conversion | `markdown` | Automatically converted to `post` JSON |
| Precisely control the reply payload | `content` | You provide the exact JSON |
| Reply with media | `image` / `file` / `video` / `audio` | Shortcut uploads URLs, or cwd-relative local files automatically |

### `text` vs `markdown`

- Use `text` when the reply should remain plain text and you want exact control over line breaks, spacing, indentation, code samples, or literal Markdown characters.
- Use `markdown` when you want a lightweight formatted reply and you accept that the shortcut will normalize and rewrite parts of the content before sending.
- Use `content` when you need exact `post` JSON, a card, a title, multiple locales, or any structure that `markdown` cannot express reliably.

## What `markdown` Really Does

`markdown` does **not** send arbitrary raw Markdown to the API.

The shortcut:

1. Forces `msg_type=post`
2. Resolves remote Markdown images like `![x](https://...)`
3. Normalizes the Markdown for Feishu post rendering
4. Wraps the final content as:

```json
{"zh_cn":{"content":[[{"tag":"md","text":"..."}]]}}
```

So `markdown` is a convenience mode, not a full Markdown compatibility layer.

### Current Markdown Caveats

- It does **not** promise full CommonMark / GitHub Flavored Markdown support.
- It always becomes a `post` payload with a single `zh_cn` locale.
- It does **not** let you set a `post` title.
- Headings are rewritten:
    - `# Title` becomes `#### Title`
    - `##` to `######` are normalized to `#####` when the content contains H1-H3
- Consecutive headings are separated with blank lines after heading normalization.
- Block spacing and line breaks may be normalized during conversion.
- Code blocks are preserved as code blocks.
- Excess blank lines are compressed.
- Already-uploaded `img_xxx` image keys are the most reliable Markdown image input.
- Local paths (e.g. `![x](./a.png)`) are **not** supported directly in `markdown` and will not be auto-uploaded.
- Remote URLs (`https://...`) will be auto-downloaded and uploaded at runtime; if the download or upload fails, the image is removed with a warning.

If you need exact output, use `msg_type: 'post'` with `content` instead of `markdown`.

### Image Constraint for `markdown`

When using `markdown` with images, prefer pre-uploading via `images.create` and referencing `![alt](img_xxx)` for predictable results. Remote URLs may work but are not guaranteed.

**Steps:**

```js
// 1. Upload image to get image_key
lark_api({ tool: 'im', op: 'images.create', args: { data: { image_type: 'message' }, file: './diagram.png' } })
// Returns: {"image_key":"img_v3_xxxx"}

// 2. Use image_key in markdown reply
lark_api({ tool: 'im', op: 'messages-reply', args: { message_id: 'om_xxx', markdown: '## Result\n\n![diagram](img_v3_xxxx)\n\nSee above for details.' } })
```

## Preserving Formatting

If the reply contains multiple lines, code blocks, indentation, tabs, or a lot of escaping, put explicit `\n` escapes inside the string value.

### When formatting must be preserved

Use `text`:

```js
lark_api({ tool: 'im', op: 'messages-reply', args: { message_id: 'om_xxx', text: 'Received\nI will check this today.\nOwner: alice' } })
```

```js
lark_api({ tool: 'im', op: 'messages-reply', args: { message_id: 'om_xxx', text: '```sql\nselect * from jobs;\n```' } })
```

This keeps the reply as plain text instead of converting it to a `post`.

### When formatting does not need exact preservation

Use `markdown`:

```js
lark_api({ tool: 'im', op: 'messages-reply', args: { message_id: 'om_xxx', markdown: '## Follow-up\n\n- I reproduced it\n- I am fixing it' } })
```

This is better for quick readable formatting, but the final payload may still differ from the source text because headings and spacing are normalized before sending.

## Commands

```js
// Reply to a message (plain text, text is recommended for normal replies)
lark_api({ tool: 'im', op: 'messages-reply', args: { message_id: 'om_xxx', text: 'Received' } })

// Equivalent manual JSON
lark_api({ tool: 'im', op: 'messages-reply', args: { message_id: 'om_xxx', content: '{"text":"Received"}' } })

// Reply as a bot
lark_api({ tool: 'im', op: 'messages-reply', args: { message_id: 'om_xxx', text: 'bot reply', as: 'bot' } })

// Reply with preserved multi-line text
lark_api({ tool: 'im', op: 'messages-reply', args: { message_id: 'om_xxx', text: 'Line 1\nLine 2\n  indented line' } })

// Reply inside the thread (message appears in the target thread)
lark_api({ tool: 'im', op: 'messages-reply', args: { message_id: 'om_xxx', text: "Let's discuss this", reply_in_thread: true } })

// Reply with basic Markdown (will be converted to post JSON)
lark_api({ tool: 'im', op: 'messages-reply', args: { message_id: 'om_xxx', markdown: '## Reply\n\n- item 1\n- item 2' } })

// Reply with Markdown containing an image (must pre-upload via images.create)
lark_api({ tool: 'im', op: 'images.create', args: { data: { image_type: 'message' }, file: './screenshot.png' } })
// Use the returned image_key
lark_api({ tool: 'im', op: 'messages-reply', args: { message_id: 'om_xxx', markdown: '## Screenshot\n\n![screenshot](img_v3_xxxx)\n\nConfirmed.' } })

// If you need exact post structure, send JSON directly
lark_api({ tool: 'im', op: 'messages-reply', args: { message_id: 'om_xxx', msg_type: 'post', content: '{"zh_cn":{"title":"Reply","content":[[{"tag":"text","text":"Detailed content"}]]}}' } })

// Reply with a local image (uploaded automatically before sending)
lark_api({ tool: 'im', op: 'messages-reply', args: { message_id: 'om_xxx', image: './photo.png' } })

// Reply with a local file (uploaded automatically before sending)
lark_api({ tool: 'im', op: 'messages-reply', args: { message_id: 'om_xxx', file: './report.pdf' } })

// Reply with a local video (video_cover is required as the video cover)
lark_api({ tool: 'im', op: 'messages-reply', args: { message_id: 'om_xxx', video: './demo.mp4', video_cover: './cover.png' } })

// With an idempotency key
lark_api({ tool: 'im', op: 'messages-reply', args: { message_id: 'om_xxx', text: 'Received', idempotency_key: 'my-unique-id' } })
```

## Media Input Rules

- Media flags accept an existing key (`img_xxx` / `file_xxx`), an `http://` or `https://` URL, or a local file path.
- Local paths must be relative to the current working directory and stay within it after resolving `..` and symlinks.
- Absolute paths such as `/tmp/photo.png` are rejected. Run the command from the file's directory and pass `./photo.png`, or copy the file into the current directory first.

## Parameters

| Parameter | Required | Description                                                                                                                                                                                   |
|------|------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `message_id` | Yes | ID of the message being replied to (`om_xxx`)                                                                                                                                                 |
| `msg_type` | No | Message type (default `text`). If you use `text` / `markdown` / media args, the effective type is inferred automatically. Explicitly setting a conflicting `msg_type` fails validation |
| `content` | One content option | Exact reply content as JSON. The JSON must match the effective `msg_type`                                                                                                                   |
| `text` | One content option | Plain text reply. Best default when you need exact text and formatting preservation                                                                                                           |
| `markdown` | One content option | Convenience Markdown input. Internally converted to `post` JSON with Feishu-specific normalization                                                                                            |

| `file` | One content option | Cwd-relative local file path, URL, or `file_key` (`file_xxx`)                                                                                                                                 |
| `video` | One content option | Cwd-relative local video path, URL, or `file_key` (`file_xxx`); **must be used together with `video_cover`**                                                                                |
| `video_cover` | **Required with `video`** | Cwd-relative local cover image path, URL, or `image_key` (`img_xxx`)                                                                                                                          |

> **Mutual exclusivity rule:** `text`, `markdown`, `content`, and `image`/`file`/`video`/`audio` cannot be used together. Media args are also mutually exclusive with each other.
>
> **Video cover rule:** `video` **must** be accompanied by `video_cover`. Omitting `video_cover` when using `video` will fail validation. `video_cover` cannot be used without `video`.

## Common Mistakes

- Choosing `markdown` when you actually need exact plain text. If exact line breaks and spacing matter, use `text` with explicit `\n` escapes.
- Assuming `markdown` supports all Markdown features. It does not; it is converted into a Feishu `post` payload and rewritten first.
- Putting local image paths inside Markdown like `![x](./a.png)`. `markdown` does not auto-upload those paths.
- **Using local file paths inside Markdown image syntax** (e.g. `![x](./a.png)`) with `markdown`. Local paths are not auto-uploaded and will not render as an image. Pre-upload via `images.create` to get an `image_key` instead.
- Using `content` without making the JSON match the effective `msg_type`.
- Explicitly setting `msg_type` to something that conflicts with `text`, `markdown`, or media args.
- Mixing `text`, `markdown`, or `content` with media args in one call.

## Return Value

```json
{
  "message_id": "om_xxx",
  "chat_id": "oc_xxx",
  "create_time": "1234567890"
}
```

## Usage Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Reply in the main chat stream

```js
lark_api({ tool: 'im', op: 'messages-reply', args: { message_id: 'om_xxx', text: 'OK, I will handle it' } })
```

The reply appears in the main chat stream and references the target message.

### Scenario 2: Reply inside a thread

```js
lark_api({ tool: 'im', op: 'messages-reply', args: { message_id: 'om_xxx', text: 'Let me take a look at this', reply_in_thread: true } })
```

The reply appears in the target message's thread and does not show up in the main chat stream.

## @Mention Format (text / post)

- Recommended format: `<at user_id="ou_xxx">name</at>`
- @all: `<at user_id="all"></at>`
- The shortcut normalizes common variants like `<at id=...>` and `<at open_id=...>` into `user_id`, but `user_id` remains the recommended documented form

## Notes

- `message_id` must be a valid message ID in `om_xxx` format
- `content` must be valid JSON
- When using `content`, you are responsible for making the JSON structure match the effective `msg_type`
- `reply_in_thread` adds `reply_in_thread=true` to the API request
- `reply_in_thread` is mainly meaningful in chats that support thread replies
- `image`/`file`/`video`/`audio`/`video_cover` support existing keys, URLs, and cwd-relative local file paths; the shortcut uploads local paths and URLs first, then sends the reply; both the upload and send steps use the same identity (UAT when `as: 'user'`, TAT when `as: 'bot'`)
- If the provided media value starts with `img_` or `file_`, it is treated as an existing key and used directly
- `markdown` always sends `msg_type=post`
- If you explicitly set `msg_type` and it conflicts with the chosen content arg, validation fails
- When using `video`, `video_cover` is required as the video cover
- Failures return error codes and messages
- `as: 'user'` uses a user access token (UAT) and requires the `im:message.send_as_user` and `im:message` scopes; the reply is sent as the authorized end user
- `as: 'bot'` uses a tenant access token (TAT), and requires the `im:message:send_as_bot` scope
- When using `markdown` with images, pre-uploading via `images.create` to obtain an `image_key` is recommended for reliability; remote URLs may be auto-resolved at runtime, but if download/upload fails the image is removed with a warning; local paths are not supported
